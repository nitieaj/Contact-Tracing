# Contact-Tracing
Explore and extrapolate any relationship between social distancing and clinical risk. Medical literature and science of spread of communicable diseases provides support for social distancing to help minimise the spread of Covid-19. Tracking compliance in the population has recently become subject to socially controllable,uncontrollable and legal factors. The ubiquitous nature of the user`s mobile behaviour suggest that contact tracing via hand held devices might be a non invasive method of guiding compliance. This project attempts to combine ICU patient data synthesized from real life scenarios combined with randomized geolocation and simulated cellular RF AIR interface parameters of the mobile devices.
